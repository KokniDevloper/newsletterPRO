# Newsletter Pro

A self-hosted, open-source newsletter and mailing list manager  
built with PHP + MySQL for learning backend fundamentals.

> Not a SaaS. One admin. Your server. Your data.

---

## ✨ Features
- Single-admin authentication
- Mailing list CRUD (add / read / update / delete emails)
- Clean PRG-based backend flow
- Session-protected dashboard
- Dark-mode focused UI

---

## 🚧 Project Status
**Beta / Pre-Release**

Core backend is functional.  
Email sending is **planned for v1.0**.

---

## 🧠 Why this project?
This project exists to:
- learn backend data flow
- understand auth, sessions, PRG
- build a real, self-hosted tool
- make my first functional backend system
- and I unexpectedly got PHP as a major mandatory 😓

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- PHP (no framework)
- MySQL
- HTML + CSS
- No JavaScript (yet)

---

## 🧪 Local Setup
1. Clone the repo
2. Place inside `htdocs`
3. Start Apache + MySQL
4. Visit `index.html`
5. Follow the setup flow (Just Click Let's Go!)
    (Make sure you have no database with the name newsletterpro; and if exists you need to either drop that database or change the database name throughout the php interaction files)

---

## Deployment Note

This project is currently designed for local development (localhost).

If you intend to run it on a personal server:
- You will need to update database connection details in `initialize.php`
- Additional configuration may be required

⚠️ The project is still under active development and is not production-hardened.

## 🗺 Planned Features for Next Release (0.3)

- Make the user flow more efficient through login process.
- Further ui improve.
- Centralized database connection for all files.
- And probably something more 😁
